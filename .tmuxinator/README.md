To install tmuxinator projects, execute the following:
```
cd ~/dotfiles/.tmuxinator/
wget <link>
```
with `<link>` the url of the raw file of the desired project as hosted in @tibotiber's gist: https://gist.github.com/tibotiber/81fe92c5516793a4d5a9.

You can then use them with `mux start <project>`
